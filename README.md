# Chatbot
Primitive chatbot that reads information from CSV files. The chatbot uses keyword identification in an attempt to return back relevant information to the question asked. This project was started with hopes of learning more about Natural Language Processing, but instead just turned into a short side-project. Some questions are supported but the chatbot may struggle with some inputs.
